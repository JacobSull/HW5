This assignment implements a simplified version of the game of Scrabble. It uses a single line, where the player has 7 characters to build a word out of and place on the board. The letters are randomly chosen and can run out if the player plays enough. This program utilizes the JQuery Dragging and Dropping to move Scrabble tiles onto the board. It uses an associative array to keep track of all the possible Scrabble pieces.

The game will keep track of your current score as you move tiles to and from your rack and board, it will keep track of your total score through the different words, and it will keep track of your current word on the board. The game uses two bonus squares of double word, which doubles the score for that word, if a tile is on top of it. The Next Word button clears the board and fills the rack up to 7 tiles, including the current tiles. This can be done until there are no tiles left. The Restart button clears the board, resets the rack, and total score.
I wasn't able to implement the tiles snapping back to the rack, or being able to choose a piece from a blank tile.
